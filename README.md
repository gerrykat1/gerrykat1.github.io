ABM that explores the effects of being asked “Where are you really from?” multiple times.
This NetLogo Agent-based model explores the effects on non-native English speaking and/or immigrant students, of being asked “Where are you really from?” multiple times. An example scenario in a bias busting workshop (scs4all.cs.cmu.edu/biasbusters/) is meeting someone new, asking “where are you from?”, and if they look or sound like they may be from outside the US, but answer something like “Rhode Island”, often are then asked “Where are you really from?”.
